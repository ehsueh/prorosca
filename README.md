# Prorosca Lending Protocol Smart Contract

A Solidity smart contract that powers the on-chain mechanics of a peer-to-peer ROSCA (Rotating Savings and Credit Association) lending protocol. It allows participants to contribute funds periodically, take turns receiving the pooled funds, and ensures fair, trustless management through blockchain automation.

## Features

- On-chain enforcement of ROSCA cycles
- Participant registration and group creation
- Periodic contribution handling
- Payout scheduling and distribution
- Supports penalties for missed contributions
- Transparent and auditable by design
